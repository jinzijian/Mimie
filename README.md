# Mimie  
The World’s First Open-Source **AI Video Agent**

Mimie is not just another tool — it is the first open-source implementation of the **AI Video Agent** paradigm.  
It redefines video generation by moving beyond clip creation, enabling AI to **plan, direct, and complete entire productions**.

## 🧩 What is an AI Video Agent?  

We define the **AI Video Agent** as a new paradigm that must provide three essential capabilities to cover the full spectrum of video creation:

- **Fully Generative**  
  - **Input**: Text description (prompt)  
  - **Output**: Script planning → segmented generation → automatic assembly → complete long-form video  

- **Semi-Generative**  
  - **Input**: User-provided assets (images or clips)  
  - **Output**: Blend real media with generated segments to create a new video  

- **Pure Editing**  
  - **Input**: Existing media library  
  - **Output**: Automatic script → clip selection → transitions/subtitles/music → polished final cut

## 🎬 Why Do We Need AI Video Agents?  

Current video generation models (Veo, Luma, Pika, etc.) are powerful but limited:  

- They only produce short clips (seconds long)  
- They lack script planning and story continuity  
- They cannot assemble complete videos without manual editing  
- They cannot understand or reuse existing media assets  

In contrast, the **AI Video Agent** unifies these capabilities into an end-to-end pipeline:  

- **Script Planning** – analyze the task, produce structured storylines and transitions  
- **Segmented Generation & Review** – create video/image assets scene by scene with quality control  
- **Automated Assembly** – edit, stitch, and finalize into a complete long-form video  
- **Media Understanding & Reuse** – analyze, organize, and integrate existing assets  

👉 In other words, video models are just the **“camera,”** while the AI Video Agent is the **“director.”**
