# Mimie  

**The World’s First Open-Source AI Video Agent**  
*Mimie defines a new paradigm: the AI Video Agent. From script planning to multi-segment generation and automated editing, Mimie transforms raw ideas and media into complete, coherent, long-form videos.*

## 🎬 What is an AI Video Agent?  

Current video generation models (Veo, Luma, Pika, etc.) are powerful but limited:  
- They **only produce short clips** (seconds long)  
- They **lack script planning** and story continuity  
- They **cannot assemble complete videos** without manual editing  

**Mimie introduces the concept of the AI Video Agent:**  
1. **Script Planning** – analyze the task, write a structured storyline with scenes and transitions  
2. **Segmented Generation & Review** – generate video/image assets piece by piece, with quality control  
3. **Automated Assembly** – edit, stitch, and finalize into a complete long-form video  

👉 In other words, **Mimie elevates AI from “generating clips” to “directing an entire production.”**

## 🧩 Three Modes of Video Creation  

Mimie redefines video generation into three fundamental task types:  

1. **Fully Generative**  
   - Input: Text description (prompt)  
   - Output: Multi-segment video, scripted → generated → assembled automatically  

2. **Semi-Generative**  
   - Input: User-provided assets (images or video clips)  
   - Output: Mimie blends real media with generated segments, creating a new video  

3. **Pure Editing**  
   - Input: Existing media library  
   - Output: Mimie writes the script, selects clips, applies transitions/subtitles/music, and exports a polished final cut
